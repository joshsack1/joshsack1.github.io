For the last six and a half years I have spent thousands of hours of my life on twitter. In that time I had many interactions (positive and negative), learned countless things, fallen for a few hoaxes, and sent tens of thousands of tweets.

I don't know how twitter will change as Musk fails to realizes his vision, realizes that his vision was fatally flawed all along, comes up with a new vision, and fails to realize this one, but it does present an opportunity. I have stagnated online over the last two years, and the prospect of change on my main social network has given me jolt I needed to start changing.

 At first I thought that mastodon (you can find me there @Joshsack@econtwitter.net) could serve as a plug and play twitter replacement, but it is not twitter (in many good and some bad ways), and even if it was, I have come to the decision that I would be better served focusing my posting energy on something more personal and in depth. 

 Given that I was going to need a personal website towards the end of my PhD, I thought it would make sense to build one and use it as a blog in the years before it will be anything more than that.

 # What this blog will be

 As of right now, I am not sure what this blog will be. I don't know how often I will post, although I can guess that the subjects I write about will be similar to those I tweet about, Politics, Economics, Liverpool, running, the Julia programming language, books I read, and Movies and TV that I watch (although I will do my best to keep my game of thrones theories to anonymous subreddits).
