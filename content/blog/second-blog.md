Yes, but not for the reason you think.
# It Isn't the SuperShoes
In the last few years, there have been countless thinkpieces about how Nike's "supershoes" are taking something out of running. This is not one of them. I have run in vaporflys and alphaflys, and while they are great shoes to race in, those miles did nothing to convince me that they could do anything to help me beat someone who was faster than me. The shoes may be great at minimizing the energy a runner creates that is wasted, but Eliud Kipchoge ran 26.2 miles in under two hours because trained extremely hard and was able to eliminate things like elevation change, wind resistance, and the fact that there are no humans capable of pacing him through the end of a marathon if they have to start it with him. Galen Rupp's 2016 Olympic marathon bronze is a little bit suspect, but that is neither here nor there. This will not be a piece about the great work Nike's engineers have done. Rather, it will be about how their marketers have used those achievements to promote a style of running that is alienating masses of people from the sport.
