I have stagnated online over the last two years, and the prospect of change on my main social network has given me jolt I needed to start changing.</p><p>At first I thought that mastodon (you can find me there @Joshsack@econtwitter.net) could serve as a plug and play twitter replacement, but it is not twitter (in many good and some bad ways), and even if it was, I have come to the decision that I would be better served focusing my posting energy on something more personal and in depth.</p><p>Given that I was going to need a personal website towards the end of my PhD, I thought it would make sense to build one and use it as a blog in the years before it will be anything more than that.</p><h1 id=what-this-blog-will-be>What this blog will be</h1><p>As of right now, I am not sure what this blog will be. I don&rsquo;t know how often I will post, although I can guess that the subjects I write about will be similar to those I tweet about, Politics, Economics, Liverpool, running, the Julia programming language, books I read, and Movies and TV that I watch (although I will do my best to keep my game of thrones theories to anonymous subreddits).</p></div><div class=post__footer></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer__base"><ul class=footer__list><li class=footer__item>&copy;
